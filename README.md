# Restaurant Management System

This repository contains the necessary Java classes for a restaurant management system. These classes are designed to handle various aspects of restaurant operations such as menu management, customer orders, and payment receipts.

## Credits

This project was presented to us by **Sir Jomari Joseph Barera**, an instructor at Visayas State University (VSU), during our OOP in Java course. I would like to express our gratitude to Sir Jomari Joseph Barera for providing us with this problem and guiding us throughout the development process.

## Classes

The repository includes the following Java classes:

1. `Appetizer.java`: Represents an appetizer item on the menu. It extends the `Food` class.
2. `Customer.java`: Represents a customer visiting the restaurant. It contains customer information and methods for managing orders.
3. `Dessert.java`: Represents a dessert item on the menu. It extends the `Food` class.
4. `Food.java`: An abstract class representing a food item on the menu. It provides common properties and methods for all food items.
5. `Main.java`: The main class to execute the restaurant management system. It contains the main method.
6. `MainCourse.java`: Represents a main course item on the menu. It extends the `Food` class.
7. `Menu.java`: Represents the restaurant menu. It contains a collection of food items and methods for managing the menu.
8. `Order.java`: Represents a customer order. It contains information about the ordered items and methods for managing the order.
9. `PaymentReceipt.java`: Represents a payment receipt for a customer order. It contains information about the payment and ordered items.
